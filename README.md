FastMySQL for Docker
====================

[![](https://badge.imagelayers.io/chrismacp/fastmysql:latest.svg)](https://imagelayers.io/?images=chrismacp/fastmysql:latest 'chrismacp Image Layers')

**This documentation is copied from https://github.com/zanox/docker-mysql which this project was based upon.**

This is a MySQL Database image tuned for fast start up times, designed to be
extended for purposes of providing fixtures.

The Official MySQL Image, while Ok to use as a normal database, does too many
things on startup. Instead we install the database directory and preload the
schema during build and commit the result to disk.

The result is an image that, once built, can be stopped and started in a
fraction of a second, making it suitable to use as part of your integration
test suite.

How to use this image
---------------------

Extend this image within your `Dockerfile` using the FROM directive. Do all the
setup work needed during the build. You can use any tools you want as long as
you wrap the commands in `start-mysql` and `stop-mysql`. The changes to the
database directory will then be commited as a file system layer by docker.

The reasoning behind using the start and stop commands is that it allows you
to split up your setup procedure and leverage docker's caching mechanism,
rather than executing all the steps as one large shell script.

The disadvantage is of course COW duplication of any touched tables for each RUN
directive.

Example Dockerfile:

```
COPY schema.sql /
RUN start-mysql && \
    mysql < schema.sql && \
    echo "status" | mysql && \
    stop-mysql
```


Notes on the Makefile
=====================

You can try this project out by running `make build run` and connecting to
default mysql port on your dockerhost. The Makefile makes trying the project
out consistent and simple. I would encourage you to use it as a template for
your own project.
